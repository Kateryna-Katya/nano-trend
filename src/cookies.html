        <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Nano Trend</strong>! To enhance your experience with our consulting blog, ensure the correct operation of our advanced digital infrastructure, and analyze user activity across the EU, we use cookies and similar technologies. This policy explains in detail which tools we use to develop our project.
        </p>

        <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          A cookie is a small piece of data that our website stores on your device when you explore our growth strategies or innovative solutions. This allows the platform to "remember" your preferences (e.g., region of presence — Italy, interface language, or content display settings) so you don't have to reconfigure them on every visit.
        </p>

        <h2>What Types of Cookies Do We Use?</h2>
        <p>
          We classify the cookies used on nano-trend.org into the following categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> These files are critical for the platform's operation and access to restricted blog sections. Without these cookies, providing the expert services you request (e.g., submitting a consultation form) would be technically impossible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytical and Performance Cookies:</strong> We use these tools to assess project prospects. They collect anonymous information about how visitors interact with our innovation materials, helping us optimize the website structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> These allow the site to remember your choices to provide a more personalized experience, which is crucial for effective consulting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advertising (Marketing) Cookies:</strong> These technologies help us show you only relevant offers regarding passive income technologies and advanced digital solutions in Europe.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
        <p>The primary goals of implementing cookies on the Nano Trend platform are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensuring the stable and secure operation of our digital infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Analyzing user behavior to improve consulting methodologies.</li>
          <li>Personalizing educational content for your professional growth.</li>
          <li>Providing up-to-date news about the platform in Italy and the EU.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          You have full control over the data used. Most modern browsers allow you to block or delete cookies in the "Settings" menu. Please note that disabling strictly necessary cookies may lead to the incorrect operation of interactive elements on our site, including feedback forms.
        </p>

        <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology or EU legislation in 2026. We recommend that you periodically check this page to stay informed about how we protect your digital space.
