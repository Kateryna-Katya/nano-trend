      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

      <h2>Eligibility for a Refund</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Mismatch:</strong> If the content of the provided consultation, analytical report, or course differs significantly from the program stated on the <strong>nano-trend.org</strong> website at the time of purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical Failures:</strong> In the event of critical errors within the <strong>Nano Trend</strong> digital infrastructure that make access to paid materials impossible and were not resolved within a reasonable timeframe (up to 48 hours).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>"Cooling-off Period" (EU Regulation):</strong> According to EU law, you have the right to cancel your purchase within 14 (fourteen) calendar days from the date of payment, provided you have not yet accessed the bulk of the materials or received a personal consultation.
        </li>
      </ul>
